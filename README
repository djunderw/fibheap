This is a partial MATLAB implementation of the Fibonacci Heap data structure. It began as a project for a course, and ended up not being useful for the originally intended purpose due to locality of reference.

See the "README.pdf" file for instructions on use, a description of the originally intended purpose, and details on what's missing in this partial implementation.
